# Red Health Smart Discount Allocation Engine
This repository contains the source code for the Smart Discount Allocation Engine, a web application designed to help managers intelligently and fairly distribute a discount budget among sales agents. The tool uses a weighted algorithm based on multiple performance indicators to ensure that the allocation is data-driven, transparent, and aligned with business goals.

The application provides a clean, interactive interface for inputting a total budget, managing a list of sales agents with their performance data, and instantly calculating the optimal distribution of funds.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Budget Configuration:** Set the total available discount budget that needs to be distributed.
-   **Full Agent Management:** Easily add, remove, and edit sales agent profiles and their metrics on the fly.
-   **Multi-Factor Evaluation:** Allocations are based on a comprehensive set of metrics for a holistic assessment:
    -   **Performance Score** (0-100)
    -   **Seniority** (in months)
    -   **Target Achievement** (%)
    -   **Number of Active Clients**
-   **Weighted Allocation Algorithm:** A transparent weighting system determines the importance of each metric in the final calculation.
-   **Instant Calculation & Results:** View the allocated discount for each agent, the percentage of the total budget they receive, and a brief justification for the allocation decision.
-   **Dashboard Summary:** Get a quick overview of the total budget, the total allocated amount, and the remaining balance.
-   **Export to JSON:** Download the final allocation results in JSON format for record-keeping or further analysis.
-   **Responsive Interface:** A clean and modern UI built with Tailwind CSS that works seamlessly across all screen sizes.

## How the Allocation Works

The core of the engine is a multi-step calculation process designed for fairness and accuracy:

1.  **Normalization:** To compare different metrics (e.g., a score out of 100 vs. seniority in months), the engine first normalizes each agent's metrics to a common scale (0 to 1). This ensures that no single metric with a large range disproportionately affects the outcome.

2.  **Weighted Composite Score:** A composite score is calculated for each agent by applying predefined weights to their normalized metrics. The current weights are:
    -   `Performance Score`: 35%
    -   `Target Achievement`: 30%
    -   `Seniority`: 20%
    -   `Active Clients`: 15%

3.  **Proportional Distribution:** The total discount budget is then distributed among the agents in proportion to their individual composite scores. Agents with higher composite scores receive a larger share of the budget.

4.  # üßÆ How calculateAllocation() Works

The `calculateAllocation()` function is the core of the Smart Discount Allocation Engine. It takes in the total available discount budget (kitty) and a list of sales agents with their respective performance metrics. It returns a fair, transparent, and explainable allocation for each agent using a weighted multi-metric algorithm.

### üî¢ Input Parameters

- `totalKitty`: `number` ‚Äî The total discount budget to be distributed.
- `agents`: `Array<SalesAgent>` ‚Äî A list of sales agents, each with the following fields:
  - `performanceScore` (0‚Äì100)
  - `targetAchievement` (percentage)
  - `seniorityMonths` (number)
  - `activeClients` (number)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Logic

 4.1. *Normalization*

Since the input metrics have different scales (e.g., 0‚Äì100 for performance, raw numbers for clients), we normalize each metric to a common 0‚Äì1 range:

normalizedValue = (value - min) / (max - min)

4.2. *Weighted Composite Score Calculation*

Each normalized metric is multiplied by its assigned weight, and all are summed to get a composite score for each agent:

| Metric             | Weight |
|--------------------|--------|
| Performance Score  | 35%    |
| Target Achievement | 30%    |
| Seniority          | 20%    |
| Active Clients     | 15%    |


compositeScore = 
  normalizedPerformance * 0.35 +
  normalizedTarget       * 0.30 +
  normalizedSeniority    * 0.20 +
  normalizedClients      * 0.15

 4.3. *Proportional Budget Distribution*

Once all composite scores are computed, the total kitty is distributed proportionally:

agentAllocation = (agentCompositeScore / totalCompositeScore) * totalKitty

4.4. *Justification Generation*

Each agent also receives a human-readable explanation string based on their performance:

*Examples:*
- "High performance score and strong target achievement."
- "Average performance but high client load."

This justification is generated conditionally based on normalized values and helps build trust and transparency in the allocation process.
